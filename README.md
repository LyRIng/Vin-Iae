## VIN-IAE Analog Signal Input Module
(original version 2012 - updated 09.2022)

### Introduction
The VIN-IAE board from [L&R Ingenier√≠a](https://www.lyringenieria.com.ar/language/es/)  is an auxiliary peripheral board designed to convert nominal battery voltages of 12, 24 or 48 V (Jumper-switch selectable) to a range readable from a 0- 5 Vdc A/D converter using 0.1% metal film resistors, and at the same time connect to an ACS75x sensor board to read current values in the same range. Typical current sensors deployed are the ACS758 in 50, 100 or 150 A ranges. It has an on-board LDO regulator to supply clean power to the current sensor. It also has four DIP Switch selector output pins which can be used to identify the installed hardware configuration. The board was designed for an INTI project (PWRC2 systems) and has been deployed for over a decade in many battery-based systems for renewable energy projects. 

In the **/schem** directory a schematic of the circuit is described. The board is available with or without a DIN-R416 plastic cabinet, contact L&R Ing. for details.
